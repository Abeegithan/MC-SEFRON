# MC-SEFRON

A Matlab toolbox for Spiking Neural Network.


This toolbox uses time-varying functions as weights. If you are using time-varying weight models please cite [SEFRON](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8472924) and if you are using this toolbox please cite [MC-SEFRON](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11367).  

Regular updates on this project are posted at https://www.researchgate.net/project/Spiking-Neural-Networks-7

Example: Iris train and test dataset are given in iris_train_1.csv and iris_test_1.csv respectively. Run the Main.m file to train the MC-SEFRON. 

Note: Change the hyperparamets for other problems.
